Five fitting methods: polynomial interpolation, gaussian interpolation, polynomial least square, polynomial ridge regression, neural network\
Four parameterization method: uniform parameterization, chordal parameterization, centripetal parameterization, foley parameterization

Solve the subic spline curve. \
Change the continuity: C0 continuity, C1 continuity, G1 continuity, C2 continuity 

## subdivision

Three subdivision methods: Chaikin (2nd B-Spline), Chaikin (3rd B-Spline), 4 points interpolation
